They live a happy life outside keeping mice out of my house and barns.\nYes, they were fed more than that, I just didn't see any reason to tape their entire meal.\nI am not complaining about feeding them, I just recorded this because I thought this little ritual was funny and might bring a smile to a few people.\n\nFor licensing questions contact cjkarmann@gmail.com",

'Memory', one of its many classic songs, became an instant worldwide hit. Since then CATS has smashed records and conquered the world. Using the latest technology, all the excitement, thrill, romance and intimacy of this theatrical legend has been captured on screen. Breathtaking visuals and full digital sound (that has been completely re-recorded with a seventy piece orchestra) will leave you deep into the mysterious world of CATS as you've never seen it before -- more intoxicating and magical than you could possibly imagine. With a star cast including Elaine Paige and Sir John Mills.\n\nDonate to these worthwhile arts causes: \n\nUK: http://actingforothers.co.uk/\nUS: https://broadwaycares.org/\nAustralia: https://www.actorsbenevolentfund.org.au/\n\nDonate to NHS Charities COVID19 Appeal:\n\nhttp://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fund/NHSCharitiesCOVID19\n\nBuy and Keep The Full Show Here:\n/bsi5lz\n\nTo Purchase Cats (2019) UK only:\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=B082LGBGK3+%7C+B082LGKCNQ&linkCode=ur2&tag=catsfilm-21\n\nIf you enjoyed that why not check out these other hit musicals! :\n\n\nJoseph and The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat: /fri5lz\nPhantom of The Opera: \nLove Never Dies: Welcome to The Shows Must Go On the channel bringing you showtunes, backstage access and full performances from some of the best loved musicals in history!\n\nFeaturing melodic moments, show-stopping solos and high notes for the history books. \n\n#Cats #AndrewLloydWebber #ElainePaige #Musicals #TheShowsMustGoOn #MusicalTheatre #WestEnd #Broadway #stayhome #withme",

In childhood, allergies tormented me so much that parents had to give all our cats to other families.  But my love for cats is stronger and I cannot live without them.  Now allergies to cats almost do not bother me.  Cats and kittens give me a lot of their love and sweetness, that I have to shoot videos for all of you, so that you smile more and be overloaded with cuteness.ü•∞\n\nMusic from https://filmmusic.io\n\"Ghost Town - Spooky and Quirky Comedy\" by Rafael Krux (https://www.orchestralis.net/)\nLicense: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nMusic from https://filmmusic.io\n\"Fancy Family - Quirky and Kitschy\" by Rafael Krux (https://www.orchestralis.net/)\nLicense: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nMusic from https://filmmusic.io\n\"Holiday Weasel\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)\nLicense: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nMusic from https://filmmusic.io\n\"Imagefilm 036\" by Sascha Ende (https://www.sascha-ende.de)\nLicense: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nMusic from https://filmmusic.io\n\"Happy Clappy Castagnette\" by Sascha Ende (https://www.sascha-ende.de)\nLicense: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\n#cats #fish #funny #kittens #fishing #TeddyKittens  #britishshorthair #LuckyPaws",

    "title": "16 Things Your Cats Do for You Without You Knowing",
    "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wajzVySdkQc/default.jpg",
    "description": "As responsible cat owners, there is a long list of things that we do for our cats to keep them happy, healthy and engaged. But, did you know there are many things your feline friend does for you every day? \nIn this video, we will talk about 16 things that your cat is doing for you. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey protect you when you sleep\nMany cats are well aware that they, and their humans, are vulnerable when sleeping.\nSticking together during sleep is a means of protection and extra security for both you and them.\nAnother reason that cats like to sleep next to you is to share warmth. In the wild, animals living together often huddle to share body heat.\nWhen your cat snuggles with you, they are seeking warmth and helping your stay warm.\nOf course, cats also sleep with you to show you affection and love! \nThey make you more attractive\nSurvey findings conducted by British pet researchers have found that women were more likely to be attracted to men who like animals. Men who like cats are also more likely to be perceived by women as being nicer, more caring people.\nThey comfort you when you are sad\nCats can understand when their owners are sad or anxious through auditory and visual observations. \nMany cats come in closer proximity when their humans are depressed. Some even purr and rub themselves more once they sense that their owner is feeling blue.\nThey greet you when you come home\nAdult cats don't meow at each other.  This means your cat has refined and kept up their meows just to communicate with you. \nAnd the best thing is that your cat meows when they want to greet you. When you arrive home and your cat meows at you, they are simply saying Welcome Back.\nThey reduce your stress and anxiety\nCuddling and petting your cat produces a calm, relaxed feeling which is caused by the release of oxytocin in the brain. This feel-good chemical makes your body feel more peaceful and even helps to lower blood pressure. \nThis also translates to a decreased risk of heart disease. One study found that over a 10-year period, cat owners were 30 percent less likely to die of a heart attack or stroke than non-cat owners.\nThey heal your wounds and strengthen your bones\nPurring sound has also been long associated with a therapeutic healing ability on human bones and muscle. A cat‚Äôs purr creates vibrations at a frequency of 25-150 HZ, and studies have shown that frequencies within this range improve bone density, repair tendons, and promote healing. \nThey keep your pests under control\nNot only will your cat hunt rodents, mice, and rats around your home, but they‚Äôre also natural insect killers. Having a cat in your home means you don‚Äôt have to worry about controlling rodents and insects in your house. \nThey check your cleanliness\nCats are very clean animals and they devote a large portion of their day to self-grooming. When your cat licks you, they are trying to keep you clean. \nBut licking also fulfill your cat‚Äôs social functions. \nWhen your cat licks you, they leave behind their distinct scent that lets other cats know that you belong to their social group.\nThey care for you when you are sick\nCats and dogs have an acute sense of smell, and so have the ability to sniff out a chemical change in a human body caused by a disease. \nThere are anecdotal reports that cats respond to a sick individual by becoming clingier, empathetic, and more attentive.  \nThey help you live longer\nThere is scientific research that suggests cat owners live longer than those without pets. This is mainly because pets alleviate tension and help us relax. They keep loneliness at bay. They even help lower our blood pressure. \nThey keep your kids healthy\nA study in the scientific journal Pediatrics has found that children who live with cats have a lower predisposition for general illness. Additionally, those who do end up becoming sick, recover more quickly. This is because having a pet stimulates and strengthens a child‚Äôs immune system and helps better protect against bacteria and viruses. \nThey help you sleep better\nSleeping with cats not only reinforces the bond we have between felines and humans, it has other benefits. They can help us relax, stay warm in winter, and provide emotional security, especially for kids. This translates into a pleasant and restful sleep.\nThey fulfill your need for companionship.\nCats offer constant cuddles that help stave off social isolation. Cats tend to develop a special bond and can be quite affectionate with their number one human. \nThey bring you food\nYour cat may bring you presents ‚Äî like a dead mouse.\nThe reason why cats bring dead animals to you is because they want to share their bounty with their family. Think of it as a sign of affection and love. \nThey boost your immune system\nSharing a home with a cat exposes you to pet dander which stimulates your immune system to help reduce the risks of allergies and asthma. According to studies, children that grow up with pets are less likely to develop allergies to pets.",
